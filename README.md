# Bari_Airport
This is a project I made to discuss during my IT Lab. exam. 

This program will simulate a portion of functionalities of the Bari Airport.

The project was written in C and the data will be contained into the three .csv files.
The program also uses a .dat file (a binary file) used to confirm the boarding.

The documentation was made by Doxygen, but the project also contain a .docx file in which 
i explained all i think a reader/user needs to knows.

Enjoy :)
